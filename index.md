### DARK MODE PLEASE (LOOKING AT YOU AWS)
```
I live in a basement
I write code in the night
Then I open up the console
And have a fit from all the light
```

### mad -eq bash
```
when god created man
he also created symbols
and not the ones that clash
they show things more than,
less than, equals
but not so much in bash
```
